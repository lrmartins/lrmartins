Holothuroidea class is currently represented by six orders: Apodida, Aspidochirotida, Elasipoda, Dactylochirotida, Dendrochirotida and Molpadida, with about 1400 species. In Brazil, 37 species of holoturoids are recognized, 32 of which are shallow waters. The taxonomy of the group is quite complex, especially with regard to comparative studies between genera and species, which are commonly organized into groups of species. Although there are few studies that address the occurrence of species of the Phylum Echinodermata in Brazil, including the registration of new species for science, they do not specifically address taxonomic issues of holoturoids, leaving this Class aside. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the knowledge of the shallow-water Holothuroidea biodiversity in the country, performing the taxonomic study of species of this class, redescribing already known species, whose previous characterization lacks complementation of the external morphological components and internal dermal ossicles, prioritizing the registration of possible new species and new occurrences, in addition to expanding the geographic and/or bathymetric distribution of known species.
