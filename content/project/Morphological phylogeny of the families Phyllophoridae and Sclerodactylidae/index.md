Currently, the order Dendrochirotida comprises about 800 species, half of these being within the families Sclerodactylidae and Phyllophoridae. Regardless, most 
information about these families is from old morphological revisions (Phyllophoridae in 1954 and Sclerodactylidae not reviewed). This study appears as the first 
formal test of the monophyly of the families Sclerodactylidae and Phylllophoridae and their respective subfamilies. The present work constituted a detailed morphological 
study of the structures that compose the Holothuroidea endoskeleton which are the dermal ossicles and calcareous ring to achieve through a cladistic analysis the following 
objectives: (i) to test the monophyly of Phyllophoridae; (ii) to test the monophyly of Sclerodactylidae; (iii) to test the monophyly of the Phyllophoridae subfamilies and iv) 
to test the monophyly of the subfamilies of Sclerodactylidae. The material studied was obtained from visits and/or loans from the national and international museums. Specimens
of all orders of Holothuroidea were analyzed with the exception of Elasipodida, yielding 956 specimens belonging to 78 species, of which four were delimited as outgroups 
(i.e. Aspidochirotida, Apodida and Dendrochirotida (Cucumariidae and Psolidae) and 44 delimited as internal groups (all type specimens were analyzed). A total of 72 
morphological characters were described and illustrated through photographs or scanning electron microscopy images. The analyses were conducted with the aid of PAUP (v.4.0) 
using a parsimony algorithm Tree Bisection and Reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping (5000 replicates). This detailed morphological study allowed us to list new characters, 
to reinterpret. already established ones as well as providing corrections of misinterpretations about such structures. Sclerodactylidae was recovered as monophyletic and 
is composed of three subfamilies (all were recovered as monophyletic), Clade I, Sclerodactylinae and Thyoninae. Phyllophoridae was recovered as monophyletic and consists 
of three subfamilies (all were recovered as monophyletic), Cladolabinae, Phyllophorinae and Semperiellinae.
