The degree of isolation of oceanic islands makes these environments an excellent model for evolutionary studies. Proper
knowledge of the species composition of oceanic islands, however, is required to better understand evolutionary processes
(e.g. speciation events). A 3-year survey in the shallow waters (up to 30 m) of the Trindade and Martin Vaz oceanic
insular complex ([ProTrindade](https://www.marinha.mil.br/secirm/sites/www.marinha.mil.br.secirm/files/publicacoes/protrindade/protrindade-10anos.pdf)), 
and a literature review on the data published for these islands and for Fernando de Noronha and Sa ̃o
Pedro and São Paulo oceanic archipelagos have been conducted to document the biodiversity of echinoids and holothuroids
from these isolated Brazilian oceanic islands. Sixteen species were collected and characterized morphologically, including two
first records for the South Atlantic and one for Brazil. Comparison with conspecific specimens from the Brazilian coast and
congeners was also done. Species richness increased from six to 18; the richness in Trindade Island being the highest among the
South Atlantic oceanic islands. However, these islands remain undersampled beyond 30-m depth. Endemism was very low,
suggesting the potential role of oceanic currents and seamounts as stepping-stones in transoceanic dispersal of species to
remote islands. The Brazilian oceanic islands are impoverished oceanic outposts of the Brazilian Province; nevertheless,
endemic species and intraspecific morphological variations compared with the mainland suggest they may also be regions
of speciation. Documenting their biodiversity is critical for effective management and conservation of their marine ecosystems.
