The genus _Parathyone_ is composed of two Caribbean species, _Parathyone surinamensis_ and _Parathyone suspecta_, initially described in the genus _Thyone_ and later transferred to the 
genus _Ocnus_. In this context, the Brazilian species _Parathyone braziliensis_ (Verril, 1868) is circumscribed, a species widely distributed throughout the Brazilian coast, but 
little known taxonomically, so that its taxonomic identity and its generic position need revision. The nominal species _Phyllophorus palmae_ is, according to some authors, a 
species synonymous with _Parathyone surinamensis_. However, the occurrence of _P. surinamensis_ in Brazil is uncertain, since it was mentioned only in conference abstracts, with 
no more detailed systematic background. _Parathyone suspecta_ and _P. braziliensis_ share many morphological similarities, which, due to the precarious morphological characterization 
of both, makes their distinction very difficult. With this, several authors have questioned the validity of these species.
